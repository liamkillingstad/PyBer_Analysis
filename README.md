*Matplotlib Analysis for PyBer Ride-Share company*

## Project Overview 
### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis was to leverage data from the rideshare company "PyBer" pertaining to various aspects of its business model. 

The analysis performed is based on data obtained in the form of a CSV file provided from PyBer. This data has been processed using Python's Pandas to produce a summary dataframe as well as a chart generated using the information in the dataframe to visualize and contextualize the data. 

The analysis performed demonstrates the relationship between variables including the type of the city, the correlation between rides, and drivers and their resepctive fares. The specific tasks and insights that were generated included the following: 

-	The total number of rides by city type. 
-	The total number of drivers by city type.
-	The sum of the fares by city type.
-	The average fare per ride by city type.
-	The average fare per driver by city type.
-	The total fares for each week by city type. 

Categorically, data needed to be cleaned and organized so that we could ultimately produce visual outputs for context and analysis.

### Overview of Methods
The analysis wsas run using Matplotlib. Matplotlib is a Python graphing library and offers statistical graphical representations of the data collected. The library allows the user to manipulate the graphical representations as well and provide richer representations of data. 

Matplotlib has two main graphing methods: 

- Pandas MATLAB and,
- The object-oriented method. 

MATLAB plotting is used for quick and simple plots that require little coding, while the object-oriented method is used for more complex graphs, including those with multiple plots on the same graph and require more coding and interpretation.

MATLAB and the object-oriented method are both extremely useful when it comes to exploratory data analysis ("EDA"). Leveraging EDA at the beginning of a project (particularly with visual representations) can assist in prvoding a targeted plan for how to handle dastasets. Inspecting data quality such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers is an important first step in the analysis process and is required in producing acurate and substantive final analysis.

### Resources
This analysis was performed with the follwoing tools and files:

Related Files:
- [city_data.csv](Resources/city_data.csv)
- [ride_data.csv](Resources/ride_data.csv)

Environment:
- Version 3.9.12

Software:
- Jupyter Notebook 4.11.1


## Results 
From the table *The Summary Data Frame per City Type* we can see the results of the analysis and how city type (rural, urban, or suburban) impacted the total value of fees collected.
